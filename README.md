## Notes
This was a commission requested by Fox, who asked for it to be posted publicly for everyone to enjoy. The dead city is actually multiple parts, with different areas to discover. 
There is one preset pawn, a naked man start. For other starts, you can copy the map with Save Maps, or use character editor + dev tools to edit the pawn and add things.
